        <h3>The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon</h3>
        <p>
          Arguably the most famous military order, the Templars were founded to
          protect Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land. They became a formidable
          fighting force and a powerful financial institution before their
          abrupt and brutal suppression in 1312.
